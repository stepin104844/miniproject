 #miniproject-104844:
   * Number Guessing Game or "Guess A Number" is a very simple and short c programming gaming mini project.This game is built for students who are looking for mini-games built in c language to learn and practice some basics c language tools they are familiar with.
   * This program will generate a random number and ask user to guess it.Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.
   *If the users guess is higher than the random number,the program should display "Too high,try again".If the users guess is lower than the random number,the program should display"Too low,try again.
   *"The program should  use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number".commenting,libraries,preprocessors,variables,arithmetic operations are used.
   *The most advantage of this mini project is the ability to recognize suitations in which guessing is the only reasonable strategy even though it provides no more than a gross estimate.The ability to recognize that different levels of accuracy are possible and acceptable in different situations.Based on the mental process of decision maker,involve a major role of intuition that leads to a good solution,appropriate and satisfactory.
